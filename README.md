# clr.core.logic

A port of [clojure/core.logic](https://github.com/clojure/core.logic) library to ClojureCLR.

> A logic programming library for Clojure & ClojureScript. core.logic offers Prolog-like relational programming, constraint logic programming, and nominal logic programming for Clojure. At its heart is an original implementation of miniKanren as described in William Byrd's dissertation Relational Programming in miniKanren: Techniques, Applications, and Implementations as well as the extensions described in cKanren and αKanren. It is designed to be easily extended to forms of logic programming beyond the ones provided.
